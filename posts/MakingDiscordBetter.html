            <h1>Making Discord Better</h1>
            <p>Discord by default is <i>kind of</i> slow at times and lacks customizability. This post is solely about modifying your discord client; making it faster, snappier, have more features and so on.</p>
            <p>Introducing <a href="https://vencord.dev/">Vencord</a>, a client mod similar to BetterDiscord but better, BetterBetterDiscord üòé</p>
            <p>I switched to this from BetterDiscord purely because it is much more stable, faster, and is being actively maintained meaning no more broken plugins</p>
            <p>You can install it and also install <a href="https://openasar.dev/">OpenAsar</a>; a modification of Discord's app.asar to make the client more responsive, faster.</p>
            <p>Don't forget to also make use of the plugins available as they are quite handy and useful.</p>
            <br>
            <h3><i>Is using modifications in Discord bannable?</i></h3>
            <p>Yes, it is bannable as it is against the <a href="https://discord.com/terms/#6">Terms of Service</a> but it is quite rare that people get banned just for using modified clients alone.</p>
